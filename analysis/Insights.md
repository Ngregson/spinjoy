<h2>Proportion of genres and release years per decade</h2>

<p>**The Electronic genre is overrepresented in the sample (36%)**. This can be explained by the choice of sellers whose catalog includes a larger share of Electronic music. Next are Rock (13%) and Classical (10%).</p>

<p>If we focus on the release years of the records in the sample, we first observe that 13.6% of the records do not have a specified year. The most represented years are from the 2000s (2000, 1999, 2001 in that order). **Two-thirds of the records have a release year within the decades 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s.** These four decades have roughly the same proportion of records (between 15.9% and 18.3%).</p>

<h2>Analysis of the average price</h2>

<p>**The average price of a record in the sample is €13.48.** The average prices of records in the 'Folk, World, & Country,' Jazz, and Latin genres are higher (€22.63, €20.36, €19.10, respectively), while the prices of Pop and Electronic genres are lower (€10.85 and €7.89, respectively).</p>

<p>When examining in more detail by adding the media_condition dimension reflecting the record's condition, it is noted that the average price of Rock records in perfect condition is €29.23. 'Folk, World, & Country' records are consistently well-placed, as are Jazz records. Concerning Electronic records, only those in perfect condition have a price above the average (€15.22).</p>

<p>Now let's calculate the average price for each decade. It appears that the most expensive records on average are from the 2020s, 2010s, and 1960s (€27.98, €19.88, €19.64). Conversely, records from the 1980s and 2000s are, on average, the least expensive (€13.08 and €7.85).</p>

<p>Finally, let's calculate the average price for each "genre, media_condition, decade" association. **The most expensive records are Rock records in perfect condition from the 2020s and 2010s (€35.65, €26.19)**. It can be assumed that these records are new, explaining the high price. Following closely, **Second-hand reggae records from the 1970s are also more expensive than average** (€23.27 for Very Good+ and €20.89 for Very Good). **The same applies to classical records from the 1960s in nearly perfect condition (€21.95)**. This time, the high price is explained by the quality of the productions.</p>
